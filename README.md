# About Altijd Prijs


I started this project to learn more about web development using the Django Framework and I turned out to be very fun!

The idea of the site is that people can compare prices on different online sites for the same product, and see where they can get the best deal.

The homepage looks like this:

![home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24839014/51786456-d37ad700-2164-11e9-9480-fd4d0afad229.png)


If the user, for example, is interested in buying Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, he or she only has to type it in the search box and the following result is returned:

Following, if the user is interested in a certain product, he or she simply clicks on the link and is automatically taken to the product page of the website from where the product is coming from.


In the Home and About directories, I included the Python, CSS, and HTML files this site was based on. General files related to the Django framework, such as Settings.py, are not included.
